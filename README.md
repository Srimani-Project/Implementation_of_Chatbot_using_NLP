#  Implementation of Chatbot Using NLP 

- This project implements an intelligent chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is trained to recognize various user inputs and respond contextually based on a predefined dataset of intents and responses. Using NLTK for text processing and scikit-learn for classification, the chatbot can understand and interact with users effectively.
